# AI-Story-Teller

This is an application leveraging on AI to create stories to facilitate bonds between parents and their children.

If the application doesn't work, there might be a need to create a directory - "generated_books".

The application is still in its infancy phase and more features will be added subsequently.

1. Adding an interactive component where users can be prompted on their decisions.
2. Adding an array of different voice for users to choose from.
3. Allowing users to download in PDF format.
4. Improving the inference speed 
   
This application is still in its beta phase.
